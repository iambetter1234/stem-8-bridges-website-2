    <hr>
        when we were first dicusing on what we should do with this bridge 
        we wanted to change our design to be an arch bridge.
        <hr>
        we wanted to do this because after putting all of the info together and learningf all about bridges we thought that the arch would be the best option.
        <hr>
        after all of that we realised that the arch would be super heavy and that is what lost us the competition last time so we stuck to our currunt design but planing on making it lighter.
