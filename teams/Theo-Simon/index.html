    Our project that we are working on is Spaghetti Bridges,
        where we learn how the bridges we drive on today work and how to make them.
        In this project we will be learning vectors and different styles of bridges.
        this project we tested spaghetti bridges and try to make our best version of it.
          theres also a lot of mathematics involved like vectors and forces.
        we found it quite difficult to build the bridges because
        there was limited materials/ only glue and spaghetti which would break time to time.
